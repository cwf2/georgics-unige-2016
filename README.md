Unige Georgics Seminar
======================

This is a workset created during as part of an MA seminar on Virgil's
_Georgics_, taught by Damien Nelis at the University of Geneva in Spring 2016.
One goal of the class was to see how a collection of student annotations could
be used to support intertextual reading of the fourth book of the Georgics.

Text Server
-----------

These scripts provide a simple text-delivery service for the Tesserae corpus.
The server runs in a Vagrant virtual machine, and provides passages on request
to the html-based interface we created to display our principal text and its
intertextual links.
